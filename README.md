# http-server
This repo contains modules implementing socket functionality.

This server initiates, waits for a response from a client, and upon receiving one
prints the client's message and then sends back an HTTP 200 response.

We used pytest, datetime, sys, socket, and downloaded HTML.py from https://www.decalage.info/python/html.
